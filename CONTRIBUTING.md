## How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute to EasyEASM, here are some ways you can help:

- Reporting Bugs
- Requesting (and developing!) Features
- Code Contributions

### Help Wanted

Here are some features and improvements to enhance EasyEASM.

- - **Custom scan profiles**
   - Allow users to define custom scan profiles with specific configurations, such as different wordlists, thread counts, or scan types, and select them at runtime.

- **Interactive mode**
   - Develop an interactive mode with a menu-driven interface that guides users through scan configuration and execution.

- **Rate limiting and throttling**
   - Implement rate limiting and request throttling to avoid excessive traffic to target domains and prevent getting blocked or banned.

- **Result export formats**
   - Support for exporting scan results in various formats, such as JSON, XML, or HTML, for easier analysis and reporting.

- **Error handling and logging**
   - Improve error handling to gracefully handle failures and provide more informative error messages. Implement comprehensive logging to keep track of scan activities.

- **Integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems**
   - Allow the program to integrate with SIEM systems, making it easier to correlate scan data with other security events.

- **Graphical user interface (GUI)**
   - Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the program to make it more accessible to users who prefer a visual interface over the command line.

- **Scheduled scans**
   - Add the ability to schedule scans to run at specific intervals, ensuring continuous monitoring of subdomains.

- **Credential testing**
   - Include the option to perform credential testing against discovered subdomains to check for unauthorized access.

- **Subdomain tagging and categorization**
   - Allow users to tag and categorize discovered subdomains for better organization and analysis.

- **Integration with vulnerability scanners**
   - Enable integration with vulnerability scanning tools to automatically identify and assess vulnerabilities on discovered subdomains.

- **Multithreading and parallelism**
   - Optimize the program to utilize multithreading and parallelism effectively, improving scan performance.

- **Support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)**
   - Extend the program to handle internationalized domain names, allowing for scanning of domains with non-ASCII characters.

- **Integration with external threat intelligence feeds**
   - Integrate with external threat intelligence feeds to enrich subdomain information and identify potential threats.

- **Advanced reporting and visualization**
   - Provide advanced reporting and visualization features, including graphs, charts, and statistics on scan results.

- **Auto-updating**
   - Implement an auto-updating mechanism to keep the program and its dependencies up to date.

- **User profiles and authentication**
   - Allow users to create profiles with authentication credentials for accessing protected subdomains.

- **Distributed scanning**
   - Enable distributed scanning across multiple machines for larger-scale subdomain discovery.

- **Scripting and automation**
   - Provide a scripting interface (e.g., via APIs) for programmatic control and automation of scans.

- **Cross-platform support**
   - Ensure the program is compatible with different operating systems, specifically Windows.
